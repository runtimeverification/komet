This test demonstrates deploying two contracts (`contract_a and contract_b`) and testing their interaction.
`contract_b` calls a function in `contract_a` during execution. The test setup is defined in `kasmer.json`,
listing the directories of the two contracts.
Komet automatically compiles the contracts and runs the test.
